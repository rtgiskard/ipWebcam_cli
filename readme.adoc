= ipWebcam_cli

tool to use IPWebcam as v4l2 webcam or microphone

Thanks for the work of
https://github.com/agarciadom/ipwebcam-gst[ipwebcam-gst] and
https://github.com/Kyuunex/ip_webcam_linux_client[ip_webcam_linux_client],
which provide a reference for the operations related to v4l2 webcam and pipewire
virtual microphone.


== Requirements

- kernel module: `v4l2loopback`
- system tools: `gst-launch-1.0`, `ffmpeg`, `mpv`


== Usage

```
# check the help first
./ipWebcam_cli.py -h

# test webcam on https://10.10.10.10:1010, and force tls verification
./ipWebcam_cli.py --ip 10.10.10.10 --port 1010 --tls --ssl-strict test

# use http, select aac audio stream, and disable video
./ipWebcam_cli.py --ip 10.10.10.10 --port 1010 -vn --acodec aac test

# launch as local virtual v4l2 webcam with IPWebcam source (https without verification)
./ipWebcam_cli.py --ip 10.10.10.10 --port 1010 --tls run
```


== Todo

- [x] audio source as microphone input along with v4l2 video
- [ ] support IPWebcam with `adb` via USB cable


There're still some issues to be fixed:

. if the `run` subcommand failed for v4l2 related operation, reload `v4l2loopback` should resolve it.
	By the way, the video capture method `ffmpeg` seems to be more stable than `gst` for `run` mode.
. On default audio output device switch, the virtual microphone may loose the link from audio capture
	process to the created virtual sink, which is the input source for the virual microphone. Either
	a restart or a manually relink with `pw-link` will resolve it.
